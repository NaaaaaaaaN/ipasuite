# IPANEMAP suite

IPANEMAP suite workflow intend to provide automation in the data treatment of SHAPE Capillary Electrophorese.

It relies on :

- QuShape
- IPANEMAP
- RNAFold
- VARNA.
- Custom scripts for file conversion, reactivity normalization and aggregation.

The workflow will enable you to generate structure data for a RNA fragment analysed using SHAPE with a set of conditions (Temperature, Magnesium, Probes, etc)

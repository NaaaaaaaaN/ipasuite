# This file should contain everything to configure the workflow on a global scale.

###
# path to the samples.tsv file that contains
# one row per sample. It can be parsed easily via pandas and opened by
# libreoffice and excel
#Typically:
#```yaml
# samples: "config/samples.tsv" 
#```
samples: "config/samples.tsv"

## General Workflow configuration ##

### 
# List of studied RNA, with an identifier, and the corresponding fasta file
# The fasta file should contain a description line containing the origin of the sequence (sequence database) with its unique identifier
# all "rna_id" column value in samples.tsv must have a corresponding line in this section.
#
# *Example:*
# ```yaml
# sequences:
#   sequence_id_1: "resources/sequence1.fa"
#   sequence_id_2: "resources/sequence2.fa"
#   sequence_id_3: "resources/sequence3.fa"
#```
sequences:
  gltB2: "resources/gltB2.fa"

###
# List each condition here, each item in this line must correspond to a column of the samples.tsv file, and be also putted into format -> condition
# *Example:*
#
# ```yaml
# conditions:
#   - probe 
#   - temperature 
#   - magnesium
#   - ...
#```
conditions:
  - probe
  - interaction
  - magnesium

###
# Allow snakemake to import automatically external files
# Not fully tested yet
allow_auto_import: True

###
# Section to define filename and titles formatting 
format:
  ###
  # Format of the conditions, will be use to identify sample and construct filename.
  # All variable conditions should be referenced here
  # Name of the conditions must correspond a column header in the samples.tsv file
  #
  # *Example:* 
  # ```yaml
  # format:
  #   ...
  #   condition: "{probe}_{temperature}_{magnesium}"
  #   ...
  # ```
  condition: "{probe}_{interaction}_{magnesium}"
  ###   
  # Same as condition but for control data. {control} will be replaced by the rawdata->control variable content 
  #
  # *Example:* 
  # ```yaml
  # format:
  #   ...
  #   control_condition: "{control}_of_{probe}_{temperature}C_{magnesium}"
  #   ...
  # ```
  control_condition: "{control}_of_{probe}_{interaction}_{magnesium}"
  ###
  # Format use to create comprehensible Snakemake message when running workflow. conditions must be prefixed with "wildcards."
  #
  # *Example:* 
  # ```yaml
  # format:
  #   ...
  #   message: "{wildcards.rna_id} with {wildcards.probe} with {wildcards.temperature}Â°C {wildcards.magnesium}"
  #   ...
  # ```
  message: "{wildcards.rna_id} with {wildcards.probe} with {wildcards.interaction} {wildcards.magnesium}"

###
# Information concerning raw datas
rawdata:
  ###
  # Path to the folder containing Raw experimental data, it will be prefixed to "control_file" and "probe_file" to auto import data from this folder. Absolute path, and relative path from project root are accepted.
  #
  # *Example: 
  # ```yaml
  # rawdata:
  #   ...
  #   path_prefix: "path/to/my/raw/data/folder
  #   ...
  # ```
  path_prefix: "../../biodata"
  ###
  # Type of the raw data. It will establish the starting point of the pipeline. Either from file directly from the sequencer or already converted to csv.
  # Accepted values : "fluo-ceq8000" or "fluo-ce"
  #
  # *Example:* 
  # ```yaml
  # rawdata:
  #   ...
  #   type: "fluo-ceq8000"
  #   ...
  # ```
  type: "fluo-ceq8000" # ["fluo-ceq8000", "fluo-ce"]
  ###
  # Name of the control 
  #
  # *Example:* 
  # ```yaml
  # rawdata:
  #   ...
  #   control: "DMSO"
  #   ...
  # ```

# IPANEMAP configuration
#
# in order to calculate structures, you can define in which way you want to
# combine conditions as input for ipanemap. the `pool section` enable you to do
# so.
#
# *Example:*
#
# ```yaml 
# ipanemap:
#   ...
#   pools:
#     - id: 1M7_noMg_37C
#       rna_id: sequence1 
#       conditions:
#         - temperature: 37
#           magnesium: noMg
#           probe: 1M7
#     - id: allProbe_noMg_37C
#       rna_id: sequence1 
#       conditions:
#         - temperature: 37 
#           magnesium: noMg
#           probe: 1M7
#         - temperature: 37 
#           magnesium: noMg
#           probe: NMIA
#         - temperature: 37 
#           magnesium: noMg
#           probe: BzCN
#   ...
# ```
# 
# each run of IPANEMAP can be entirerly configure.
# to create un new run (or `pool`) add a dash in the `pools` sections
# each pool should have an unique `id` of your choice.
# 
# `rna_id` correspond to the sequence to input to IPANEMAP this id must
# correspond to and id of the `sequences` section of this configuration file.
#
# `conditions` correspond of the sets of conditions you want to be added to
# IPANEMAP run. each set of condition start with a dash and must contains all
# conditions references in the `conditions` section of this configuration file.
# 
# *In the Example:*
#
# - first pool (1M7_noMg_37C) will be executed with "sequence1"
# and with one condition: 
#   - all sample aggregated which have no magnesium, a temperature of 37C,
# and 1M7 probing 
#
# - second pool (allProbe_noMg_37C) will be executed with "sequence1"
# and with 3 conditions :
#   - all sample aggregated which have no magnesium, a temperature of 37C, and
#  1M7 probing
#   - all sample aggregated which have no magnesium, a temperature of 37C, and
#  NMIA probing
#   - all sample aggregated which have no magnesium, a temperature of 37C, and
#  BzCN probing
#
# Parameters in sampling, clustering, pareto, visualization are equivalent to
# the content of ipanemap config file. Please refer to IPANEMAP documentation
